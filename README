Description:
	C++ implementation of equalization filters based at 
	"High-Order Digital Parametric Equalizer Design" by Sophocles J. Orfanidis

Implemented next filters types:
	Butterworth
	Chebyshev Type 1
	Chebyshev Type 2

Classes description:
	Two classes of equalizers provided: eq1 and eq1.
	eq1 - equalizer with channels, which are consist of single bandpass filter.
	eq2 - every channel consist of set of precomputed filters, 
	where every filter computed for single gain value.
	eq1 and eq2 have the same API.
	See API functions below.

How to run:
	Run test_orfanidis_eq.m script using MATLAB.
	The three plots for every filter type should appear.

Usage guide:
	//Create frequency grid and equalizer objects
	freq_grid fg;
	freq_grid.set_N_bands();
	eqX equalizer(fg, filter_type);
	//Set gains for every band
	equalizer.change_gains();
	//Sample by sample processing
	equalizer.sbs_process();
