Description:
	C++ implementation of equalization filters based at 
	"High-Order Digital Parametric Equalizer Design" by Sophocles J. Orfanidis

Implemented:
	Butterworth
	Chebyshev Type 1
	Chebyshev Type 2

How to run:
	Run test_orfanidis_eq.m script using MATLAB.
	The three plots for every filter type should appear.

Usage description:
	//Create frequency grid and equalizer objects
	freq_grid fg;
	freq_grid.set_N_bands();
	eq equalizer(fg, filter_type);
	//Set gains for every band
	equalizer.change_params();
	//Sample by sample processing
	equalizer.sbs_process();
